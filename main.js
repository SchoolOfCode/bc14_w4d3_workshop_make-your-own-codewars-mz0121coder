/* 
Can you find the encrypted message?
You are given an array of numbers (from 0-25) and symbols
Each number must be transformed to its equivalent letter in the alphabet
E.g. if the number is 10, letter is 'k' (index 10)
Replace each symbol with a space character. 
Finally, join the transformed array to return a string with the hidden message

EXAMPLE:
findMessage([0, 11, 22, 0, 24, 18, '!', 1, 4, '?', 2, 14, 3, 8, 13, 6])
should return 'always be coding'

GOOD LUCK!
